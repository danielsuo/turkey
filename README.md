# Turkey

## Getting started

### Installing
- Run ```./bin/install```. This will set up the ```TURKEY_HOME``` environment variable in your ```~/.bashrc```.
- Run ```./bin/install_deps``` if on Ubuntu with root acces. Otherwise, call home and complain.
- Run ```source ~/.bashrc``` to get updated environment variables
- Run ```./bin/run.py build all``` to build all converted applications
- Run ```./bin/run.py data [APP]``` to download the data for the application you're working on. Use ```all``` to download all applications

NOTE: You may need to specify a cmake executable during build
```bash
./bin/run.py build all -e cmake3
```

### Installing on the Intel vLab cluster
Add the following to your ```~/.bashrc```
```bash
alias cmake=cmake3
source scl_source enable devtoolset-6
```

NOTE: On CentOS, you may need to upgrade gcc
```bash
# Install newer version of gcc
sudo yum install devtoolset-6*

# Set gcc to newer version in current terminal
scl enable devtoolset-6 bash
```

### Building
- Run ```./bin/run.py build [APP]``` to build the application you're working on

### Running
- Run ```./bin/run.py one [APP] -c native -n 8``` to run a one-off of the application with configuration native and 8 threads
- Run ```./bin/run.py gen jobs/example.params``` to generate a list of tasks according to a params file (parsed by ```turkey/generator.py```)
- Run ```./bin/run.py job jobs/example.jobs``` to run the jobs generated in the above step (job file has the same name and location as params file)
- Run ```./bin/run.py parse [OUTPUT_DIR]``` to generate csv file of task-level stats
- Run ```./bin/run.py viz [OUTPUT_DIR]``` to generate graphs from the job run

### Running on vLab
- Useful guide [link](http://qcd.phys.cmu.edu/QCDcluster/pbs/run_serial.html)
- Run ```./bin/run.py qsub [JOBS] -m [EMAIL]``` where JOBS is a job file or directory with job files in it. You can optionally receive emails.
- Output will be in ```$TURKEY_HOME/out```

### Statistics
- Task-level stats are parsed via the ```parse``` sub-command (see above)
- System-level stats are stored in ```[OUTPUT_DIR]/stats.csv```

## TODO: move scheduler to Python
- Job spawns a Server object which has a Scheduler
- Integrate back into blackscholes
- Check that dynamic threads are working
- Consider putting scheduler, server listener on different threads
- Test multiple blackscholes processes
- Implement "intelligent" Linux as a scheduling policy
